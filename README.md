### GreenHouse Backend
This is the Rails API built to serve as the backend of GreenHouse, hosted [here](https://greenhouse-js.herokuapp.com/) on Heroku. You can find the frontend repository [here](https://github.com/spenser6131/greenhouse-v2-frontend).

GreenHouse gives plant-moms and -dads the ability to better provide their houseplants with optimal growing environments and more consistent watering/fertilization schedules. Users can create a virtual home of different rooms, each with a 1-5 rating of the room's light and humidity levels. The rooms are then filled with plants, each with their own light and humidity requirements, as well as a few other useful stats and metrics. Plant/Room suitability is reflected in the details of each plant, helping the user determine whether a plant should be relocated.
